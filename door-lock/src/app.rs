//! The lock UI: the door-theme surface rendered as `ext-session-lock-v1` lock
//! surfaces on the *user's* running compositor, wired to the daemon's verify-only
//! reauth seam.
//!
//! The app itself holds no authority — same posture as the greeter. A background
//! worker owns the reauth [`Client`](crate::client::Client) (blocking socket I/O)
//! and talks to this UI over two channels: the UI sends [`Command`]s to the
//! worker, and the worker emits [`Message`]s back through an Iced subscription.
//! Because the daemon drops peers that idle between attempts, the worker dials a
//! fresh connection per unlock attempt instead of holding one across the locked
//! wait.
//!
//! The locked surface mirrors the greeter's disclosure posture exactly: sky,
//! clock, the password/second-factor prompt, and the default-off keyboard-layout
//! and battery indicators — no notifications, media, or session content, ever.
//! There is deliberately no session picker, no username field (the daemon binds
//! the reauth target to this process's peer-cred uid), and no power row (the
//! reauth seam has no power verb).
//!
//! Crash-safety comes from the protocol, not from this process: the compositor
//! owns the blanking, so if door-lock dies the screen stays covered — the
//! failure mode is "stays locked," never "reveals."
