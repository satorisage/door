//! The local IPC server: the daemon's side of the trust boundary.
//!
//! This is where untrusted bytes first reach the privileged core, so the
//! authorization checks live here, before any request is interpreted:
//!
//! - a **pathname** Unix socket (never the abstract namespace, which has no
//!   filesystem permissions) under a `root`-owned `0700` directory, with the
//!   socket itself `0660` so only `root` and the greeter group can reach it;
//! - an `SO_PEERCRED` check on every connection — the kernel-attested uid of the
//!   peer must match the configured greeter uid, regardless of socket
//!   permissions (defense in depth);
//! - **one** greeter at a time: connections are served sequentially, so there is
//!   never a race between two greeters over one seat;
//! - a **read timeout** so a peer that opens a connection and goes silent cannot
//!   pin the daemon;
//! - a mandatory **version handshake** ([`PROTOCOL_VERSION`]) before any other
//!   request is honored.
//!
//! Above the per-connection handling sits the **login loop** ([`serve`], D-0008):
//! when a greeter user is configured, doord owns the greeter lifecycle — it
//! launches the greeter, serves the login, performs the greeter→session VT handoff
//! (tears the greeter down before the session takes the seat), waits for the
//! session to end, and re-greets. Without a greeter user (dev), it just serves
//! whatever greeter connects.
