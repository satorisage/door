//! doord — the privileged door daemon.
//!
//! This is the trusted computing base. It is the only part of door that runs
//! with privilege, and it owns every privileged responsibility end to end:
//!
//!   - the PAM authentication conversation,
//!   - seat / VT ownership and session bookkeeping via logind,
//!   - discovering startable sessions and spawning the chosen one with a
//!     sanitized environment,
//!   - the local IPC socket that the unprivileged greeter connects to.
//!
//! Everything arriving from the greeter is untrusted: the daemon validates it,
//! acts only on requests it permits, and drops privilege as early as it can.
//! Keeping this binary small is a security property, not a style preference —
//! every line here is attack surface that runs as root.
//!
//! Built so far: process hardening baseline; the authorized, framed IPC seam;
//! the PAM auth conversation; session discovery; and the full session handoff —
//! one PAM transaction spanning auth → logind session open (`pam_systemd`) →
//! fork → seat/VT controlling-tty handoff → privilege drop → exec, with the
//! logind session closed when it exits. The end-to-end live logind run on real
//! hardware is the remaining verification.
