//! doord — the privileged door daemon.
//!
//! This is the trusted computing base. It is the only part of door that runs
//! with privilege, and it owns every privileged responsibility end to end:
//!
//!   - the PAM authentication conversation,
//!   - seat / VT ownership and session bookkeeping via logind,
//!   - discovering startable sessions and spawning the chosen one with a
//!     sanitized environment,
//!   - the local IPC socket that the unprivileged greeter connects to.
//!
//! Everything arriving from the greeter is untrusted: the daemon validates it,
//! acts only on requests it permits, and drops privilege as early as it can.
//! Keeping this binary small is a security property, not a style preference —
//! every line here is attack surface that runs as root.

fn main() {
    // Skeleton. The IPC server, PAM conversation, privilege drop, and session
    // spawn land here as the privileged-core milestone is built out — each
    // gated behind the auth-path threat model.
    eprintln!("doord: skeleton — privileged core not yet implemented");
